## New rules for Exercise 2:

The rearrangement and addition rules of my version of pig Latin are as follows:

1. Rearrangement:
                  - Locate the first occurrence of one Han Letter.
                  - Starting from this point, we extract the segment extending to the word's end.
                  - Finally, we reverse this extracted segment and prepend it to the beginning of the word, effectively repositioning it.

2. Addition:
                  - Append the word "HAN" to the end of the reversed segment.
